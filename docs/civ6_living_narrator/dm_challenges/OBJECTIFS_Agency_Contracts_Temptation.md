## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (ranked)
1. Agency-first challenge contracts — clear conditions and no punishment.
2. Temptation over enforcement — invite alternative play.
3. Clarity of state — one active challenge at a time.

## NON-OBJECTIVES
- Penalizing refusal.
- Complex multi-step quests.

## TRADEOFFS (canonical decisions)
- When challenge frequency conflicts with pacing, choose pacing.
- Accept skipped challenges to preserve agency.

## SUCCESS SIGNALS (observable)
- refusal_line usage is rare and non-punitive.
- active challenge count never exceeds one.
