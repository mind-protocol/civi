# OBJECTIFS — moment_graph

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (ranked)
1. Mythic memory — store only a few moments that matter.
2. Temporal coherence — callbacks feel earned and connected.
3. Sparsity — avoid turning memory into noisy logs.

## NON-OBJECTIVES
- Recording every event as a moment.
- Long-term story arcs beyond v1.

## TRADEOFFS (canonical decisions)
- When memory size conflicts with quality, choose quality.
- Accept decay to keep the graph sparse.

## SUCCESS SIGNALS (observable)
- Myth moments are rare and referenced with tags.
- Callbacks trigger only on overlap or time gate.
